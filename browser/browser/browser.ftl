## The main browser window's title

# These are the default window titles everywhere except macOS. The first two
# attributes are used when the web content opened has no title:
#
# default - "Mozilla Firefox"
# private - "Mozilla Firefox (Private Browsing)"
#
# The last two are for use when there *is* a content title.
# Variables:
#  $content-title (String): the title of the web content.

# there is no content title:
#
# "default" - "Mozilla Firefox"

#
# The last two are for use when there *is* a content title.
# Do not use the brand name in the last two attributes, as we do on non-macOS.
#
# Also note the other subtle difference here: we use a `-` to separate the
# brand name from `(Private Browsing)`, which does not happen on other OSes.

# Variables:
#  $content-title (String): the title of the web content.
