## Browser data types
## All of these strings get a $browser variable passed in.
## You can use the browser variable to differentiate the name of items,
## which may have different labels in different browsers.
## The supported values for the $browser variable are:
## 360se
## chrome
## edge
## firefox
## ie
## safari
## The various beta and development versions of edge and chrome all get
## normalized to just "edge" and "chrome" for these strings.
