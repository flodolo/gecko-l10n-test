### UI strings for the simplified onboarding modal / about:welcome
### Various strings use a non-breaking space to avoid a single dangling /
### widowed word, so test on various window sizes if you also want this.

## newlines in translations to control where the line break appears (e.g., to
## avoid breaking quoted text).
