# LOCALIZATION NOTE:

# This file must be saved as UTF8

# Accesskeys are defined by prefixing the letter that is to be used for the
# accesskey with an ampersand (e.g. &).

# Do not replace $BrandShortName, $BrandFullName, or $BrandFullNameDA with a
# custom string and always use the same one as used by the en-US files.
# $BrandFullNameDA allows the string to contain an ampersand (e.g. DA stands
# for double ampersand) and prevents the letter following the ampersand from
# being used as an accesskey.

# You can use \n to create a newline in the string but only when the string
# from en-US contains a \n.
