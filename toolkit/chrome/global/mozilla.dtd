<!ENTITY mozilla.quote 'Mammon slept. And the <em>beast reborn</em> spread over the earth and its numbers 
grew legion. And they proclaimed the times and <em>sacrificed</em> crops unto the 
fire, with the <em>cunning of foxes</em>. And they built a new world in their own 
image as promised by the <em><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/about/mozilla-manifesto.html"> 
sacred words</a></em>, and <em><a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/About:mozilla">spoke 
</a></em> of the beast with their children. Mammon awoke, and lo! it was 
<em>naught</em> but a follower.'>
